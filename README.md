A very simple module to add support for name fields for user import module.

The only format for names currently supported are:
* Firstname
* Lastname Firstname
* Lastname Firstname Middlename

Titles and other extras are not supported.

This module is useless without: 
* Name: https://www.drupal.org/project/name
* User import: https://www.drupal.org/project/user_import
